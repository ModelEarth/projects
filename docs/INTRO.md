# Introduction

Welcome to the ModelEarth `projects` repo — this document gives a concise introduction.

## Purpose
This repository tracks projects, experiments, and tasks related to ModelEarth's data science and environmental impact tools.

## Quick start (contributor)
1. Fork the repo, clone your fork, and create a feature branch:

gh repo fork ModelEarth/projects --clone=true
git checkout -b fix/intro-issue-###

2. Make small, well-scoped changes. Update docs or add tests when possible.
3. Run linters or local dev servers if the project requires them (see README for repo-specifics).
4. Submit a PR; reference the issue number in the PR title and description.

## How to communicate
- Post an update in the issue when you're actively working and plan to open a PR within a few days.
- Use Discord for quick Q&A, and email Loren at loren@dreamstudio.com only when your PR is ready.

## Where to look next
- See `README.md` for repository-specific setup (run commands, Docker, or webroot live-server).
- Check the `projects` issue tracker on GitHub for assigned tasks and active work.
